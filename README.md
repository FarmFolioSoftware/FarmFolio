# Spring 2024 Software I FarmFolio Project

## Instructions for testing

- See [maria_dump.sql](\be0.1\maria_dump.sql) and [DatabaseDiagram.jpeg](\DatabaseDiagram.jpeg) for the current schema of the **farmfolio** database. These will be updated as best as possible. When referencing the DB, use the same naming convention as in the diagram.

### Backend

- The backend is hosted in AWS. The frontend is configured to connect to the backend.

### Frontend
- From fe0.1, run the following command:
    - `npm install`

- Run `npm start` to open the login page
- Enter a username/password that is/is not in the database and make sure it authenticates or not appropriately.

This is a test
