/[^0-9a-zA-Z_\-@.\s]/gi - validate the string is all alphanumeric characters, -, @, .
use this for the emails and all generic text fields, this MATCHES
all non-valid characters so to validate the input, do something like this:

if ([regex].test(userInputVariable)) // do something, warn them, pop up an alert, whatever

[^\d] - validate the string is all numbers
use this for the zip code and any other field in the database
where the input HAS to be all numbers - someone blew up the backend by putting
'h' for a zip code this morning
again, this MATCHES INVALID CHARACTERS, so your if statement should be written
accordingly, if the block of code inside the if statement executes, that means
the user has typed an invalid string
